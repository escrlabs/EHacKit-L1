## Project Motive

EHacKit-L1 is a cybersecurity hardware project designed to empower enthusiasts and developers with a versatile kit for hands-on exploration and learning in the field of cybersecurity. The primary goal is to provide a platform that combines various components to build, experiment, and understand different aspects of cybersecurity projects.

## Components

- **Arduino Nano:**
  The Arduino Nano is a compact and versatile microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It is well-suited for a wide range of projects due to its small size and robust capabilities, making it an excellent choice for various applications in your cybersecurity projects.

- **NodeMCU:**
  NodeMCU is an open-source IoT platform based on the ESP8266 WiFi module. It combines the capabilities of an ESP8266 with a USB interface, making it easy to develop IoT applications and projects that require wireless connectivity.

- **Digispark Attiny85:**
  The Digispark Attiny85 is a microcontroller development board based on the ATtiny85 chip. Despite its small size, it packs significant capabilities, making it suitable for compact projects where space is a concern.

- **RJ45 Jack:**
  The RJ45 Jack, also known as an Ethernet Jack, is a standardized physical interface used for connecting network cables. It plays a crucial role in networking projects, facilitating wired communication between devices in a secure and reliable manner.

- **Breadboard:**
  A breadboard is a fundamental tool in electronics prototyping. It allows you to create and test circuits without soldering, providing a convenient platform for quickly experimenting with different configurations and connections.

- **Jumper Wires (Male to Male and Female to Female):**
  Jumper wires are essential for making connections on a breadboard or between different components. Male-to-male and female-to-female jumper wires enable versatile and flexible wiring in your projects.

- **Network Cable for Crimping:**
  A network cable, often referred to as an Ethernet cable, is used to establish a wired connection between devices. In your EHacKit-L1, you may need to crimp network cables for custom lengths and configurations, allowing for tailored networking solutions.

- **RFID Reader:**
  The RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) reader is a device that can read RFID tags or cards, facilitating secure identification and access control in your projects. It adds an extra layer of authentication, making it valuable for cybersecurity applications.



EHacKit-L1 includes all the necessary drivers and a flasher tool required for seamless integration with the components.
